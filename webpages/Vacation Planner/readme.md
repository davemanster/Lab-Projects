I created (with help from AI tools) this simple calendar tool to help plan vacation at work. Its slightly buggy, but I am an amature and maybe someone can help me fix it. Its "good enough" for me.

Functionality: You are able to type in any option at the top left,which will then be your options when you click generate. I cannot get this to update in real time, not a big deal for me but feel free to improve it.

With each selection you can choose a color to outline the day with that selection.

You can type a number if you wish next to the text at the top left, and each time you select it, it will decrease by 1. This makes it easier to use for work vacations. If you decide to change it, select the bottom option which I have set to no color and just a space for it to increment by 1.

Bugs: The last option is just there to remove the subtraction of the prior selection. Deslecting or selecting the top option doesnt do that, as I tried to do. A minor inconvience.

If you update the text or color at the top left, you have to reselect it on each day for the calendar to update.
